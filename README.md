I love 🚗 cars, so will make a small analogy between AI and Vehicles 🚙 
 
So, let’s start our journey👊
 📚Minutes: 
 
🫀AI Components (vehicle components): 
·      Objects (where do you want to go)🗺️
·      Algorithm (which road, street or avenue you want to drive)🚏
·      Data (oil for your car) ⛽️
👾Machine Learning Algorithms
1.     🏅Supervised Learning Algorithm – we are able to classify our observations into specific labels.  (ex. Cars by brands labels – BMW is BWM) 
2.     🎖️Unsupervised Learning Algorithm – we are able to classify our observations by identifying patterns (ex. We car label has 4 rings there is a high probability that is Audi) 
3.     🎗️Reinforcement Learning Algorithm – we are able to take action and learn from the results  
(ex. We jump into a car and try to go off-road, we are able to pass mud and stones that is a truck)
 
🚀Aspects of AI 
🚦Features – a variable that helps the algorithm to learn. (ex. Brand, price, size, weight)
🧮Constraints – rules that limit the flexibility of your algorithm (ex. aerodynamics, fuel type, power horses) 
⛽️Data – AI learns from examples ( that our fuel: diesel, petrol, electric )
